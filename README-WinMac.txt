USAGE IN WINDOWS OR MAC OS X
============================

In  Windows, the Perl program is not installed by default. See 
http://www.perl.org/get.html to get Perl.

Step 1. Run CasOT
----------------------------------

    In Windows, double-click the file casot-win.cmd.
    In Mac OS X, double-click the file casot-mac.app.
    A command prompt window or a terminal window will be opened and wait for 
    the options.
    (The command line method to run casot.pl is still supported, please read 
    other related documents to get how to open Command Prompt in Windows or 
    Terminal in Mac OS X.)

Step 2. Use the option generator to get option string
-----------------------------------------------------

    The generator is available in a stand-alone file (opt-generator.htm) in 
    the pack or in the CasOT web-site 
    (http://eendb.zfgenetics.org/casot/option.php).
      - For multiple choices, choose one;
      - For box required for numbers, fill one or two numbers in it according 
	to the instruction;
      - For box required for file path and name, choose a file on the compute 
	(Internet Explorer 6-10) or fill the full path and name of a file 
	(other web-browsers) in it. To quilkly copy the full path of a file, 
	in Windows, users can press Shift and right-click the file, choose 
	"Copy as path"; in Mac OS X, drag and drop the file to another 
	application named getfullpath-mac.app.
    The box in the top of the page will output the option string when the 
    selections change; copy it.

Step 3. Paste the option string to the CasOT program windows
------------------------------------------------------------

    In Windows, right-click the title of the command prompt window (NOT the 
    body of it, or nothing will appear), then choose "Edit" - "Paste" in the 
    pop-up menu.
    In Mac OS X, right-click, choose "Paste".
    Then press Enter, the program will get the options and start to execute.
